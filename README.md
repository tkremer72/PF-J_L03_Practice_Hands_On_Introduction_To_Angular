# L03 Practice Hands On

Lesson 3 Practice Hands-On
Directions
For your Lesson 3 Practice Hands-On, you will be extending the project from the lesson. There is a starter project that you can download below. This Hands-On will not be graded, but we encourage you to complete it. The best way to become a great programmer is to practice! Once you have submitted your project, you will be able to access the solution on the next page.

Setup
Start off by downloading the starter project and unzipping it. The starter project will be in a folder named angular-L3-handson.

Starter Project

After unzipping, move the starter project folder to the FEFAngular folder located inside the FullStackWeb folder and rename it from angular-L3-handson to L03HandsOn.

Open up your terminal/command prompt.

Navigate to your desktop in your terminal.

cd Desktop
Next, navigate to the FullStackWeb directory in your terminal.

cd FullStackWeb
Then, navigate to the FEFAngular directory in your terminal.

cd FEFAngular
Navigate into the L03HandsOn directory:

cd L03HandsOn
Now that you are in the L03HandsOn directory, run the following:

npm install
Run the following to open your new project in VS Code (or you can open the folder within VS Code directly):

code .
Requirements
Step 1
Add the following properties and values to the AppComponent class within the app.component.ts file:

City - include the city you live in.
Tag line - make up a unique tag line.
About Me - a quick paragraph about you.
Step 2
Next, bind the above properties to the app.component.html file.

Hint! Use the same syntax as the title property.

All bound properties in the app.component.html file should be below the image:
The city should be an <h3> tag.
The tag line should be an <h5> tag.
The about me should be a <p> tag.
Step 3
Style each new element with the below requirements:

The <h3> tag should have its own background color, a padding of 4px, a dotted border, and have margin-right and margin-left of 2-10em (whatever works best for your screensize).
Give the <h5> tag a bigger font size, a different font color, and a different font style.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
